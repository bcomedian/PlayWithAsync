# PlayWithAsync
Trying different asynchronous approaches implemented in C# while reading the book "Async in C# 5.0" by Alex Davies, such as:
- EAP;
- APM; 
- TAP.
Also tried implementing TAP over EAP and TAP over APM using TaskCompletionSource.

This WPF application was written w/o applying MVVM pattern to avoid overcomplications on the logic which is not really the purpose of current investigation.
